    <p>
        Here's what we know! In this murder mystery there are:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>four rooms:</b> the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,<br/>
        <b>four weapons:</b> poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,<br/>
        <b>and four suspects:</b> Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.<br/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...
        <br/>
        <br/>
        the <b>poison</b> belongs to the <b>ballroom,</b><br/>
        the <b>trophy</b> belongs to the <b>gallery,</b><br/>
        the <b>pool stick</b> belongs to the <b>billiards room,</b><br/>
        and the <b>knife</b> belongs to the <b>dining room.</b><br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.
        <br/>
        <b>Mr. Parkes</b> was located in the <b>dining room.</b>
        <b>Ms. Van Cleve</b> was located in the <b>gallery.</b>
        <b>Mrs. Sparr was</b> located in the <b>billiards room.</b>
        <b>Mr. Kalehoff</b> was located in the <b>ballroom.</b>
    </p>
